Project for course of advanced software 
target:
implement the Conway's Game of Life, in a small application.
requirement:
The task of this project is to implement a graphical version of Conway's Game of Life. The "world" is a 16x16 grid, where a dead cell is shown as a white square and a live cell as a black square. The user should be able to set the initial configuration by clicking on cells, toggling its state for each click. It should be possible to set the number of steps to run the game, including "infinity" to have the game running until externally interrupted. With one button, the game will be started and run for the specified number of steps. Another button will single-step the game. In-between each single step, the user should be able to modify the configuration. There should also be a button to set the configuration to all cells dead.
Additional functionality, if interested:
•	A "break" button to stop the execution at any time.
•	A possibility to save configurations, and load saved configurations.
•	Larger boards
•	Interesting configurations, that can be loaded and run.
